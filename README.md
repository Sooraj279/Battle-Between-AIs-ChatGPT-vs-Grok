# Battle-Between-AIs-ChatGPT-vs-Grok
This was a competition to see which AI is better with code and creativity and the consentents were Chat GPT and Grok. The task was simple to make a beautiful looking Portfolio website using just HTML and CSS and there were a total of 3 rounds. Let's check the code to see what they came up with.

## Here are few points you need to know before your conclution
- Both Chat GPT and Grok were the free version which anyone with an internet can use.
- Both had _Reason_ & _Think_ mode enabled in them respectively
- Both started with this same prompt "Create a beautiful looking portfolio website just using html and css"
- And both were given each other's code after each response to analyse and improvise there code on each round (except for the first round).

## My Conclusion 
Although both AI did an amazing job but in terms of code and creativity according to me **Chat GPT is the winner** of this battle.

**What are your thoughts about it?**
